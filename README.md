LinerlyBot is also a Matrix bot as well!

To use LinerlyBot Matrix, [make a DM with LinerlyBot Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@linerlybot-matrix:matrix.org/), or invite LinerlyBot Matrix to a room.
It doesn't matter if it's encrypted or not, it'll work just fine. (LinerlyBot Matrix uses Pantalaimon so that it can read encrypted commands from users)
